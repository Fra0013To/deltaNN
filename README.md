# &#948;NN: Discontinuous Neural Networks

by [Francesco Della Santa](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francesco-Della-Santa) and [Sandra Pieraccini](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sandra-Pieraccini).

In this repository, we publish the codes used to implement the Discontinuous Neural Networks (&#948;NNs) presented in the paper:
_Discontinuous Neural Networks and Discontinuity Learning_, available soon in Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics (accepted).

**ATTENTION:** the github page is under construction. The code will be available soon.
